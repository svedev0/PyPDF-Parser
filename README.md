# ðŸ“„ Python PDF Parser

A PDF parser that outputs the text content of a `.pdf` file to a `.txt` file using Python. Some formatting is also done to make the raw text more presentable.

This script can be used to simply parse files or even as a part of your app. Personally, I use it for administrative automation of invoices.
